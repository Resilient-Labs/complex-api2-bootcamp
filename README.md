This complex api project is requesting a random cat breed when the button is pressed and uses that breed name to request a related image of the breed name from a different API
<hr>
This project is meant for me to further explore using different api's and is not meant for user interaction other than checking the data out of curiosity. I enjoyed figuring out these two apis and how to make them work together. It was alot of work for such a simple looking project!

Skills:  JS / HTML / CSS/ API
