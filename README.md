# National Park Service Complex API 

A National Park site. This site includes the ability for a user search for a state and a national park, within that state, with some futher details will appear. The current weather in that location is also displayed! This site uses data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, API

## Optimizations

Potentially finding improved weather API's. Goal is to improve the CSS, but for now I like it as is!

## Reflections:

This was cool to build out - the API's were definitely harder to work with, but I enjoyed displaying National Parks around the US and their corresponding climate. The CSS is, as mentioned before, something I'm hoping to update in the future.
