## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The project was create and designed with HTML and CSS. Javascript was used to fetch an API that generates random dog breeds, the data from the first API (the dog breed API), was then used as a search parameter value in the second gif API, which then searches a Gif that is displayed on the webpage.

## Optimizations (Optional):

Optional.


## Lessons Learned:

I learned in this project that gifs can be used in the place of images in web development as display appropriated. I also learned that at times the format of the data your retrieve from the API is in a format that is easily readable by another API and at other times that data needs to be converted into a format that is more easily readable..
