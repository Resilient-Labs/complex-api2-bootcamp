<b>Tech Used</b>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON
<b>What I Learned</b>: I love how in this project I was able to pull gifs from the API that I used. In previous projects it was just text, and seeing that I could add pictures too was very cool. I loved this project because it combined two of my interest. Basketball and hilarious gifs.
