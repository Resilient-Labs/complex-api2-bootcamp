# ðŸ“Š Project: Complex API 2

This api project will give you a random drink (most likely alcohol) description.

## How It Works:

**Tech Used:** HTML, JS, cocktail api, wikipedia search api

On the click of a button, the cocktail api sends a random cocktail. I extracted only the drink ingredient used for that cocktail and passed the variable that contains the drink ingredient through the wikipedia api. Then I extracted the description for the drink search and displayed it into the DOM. Some searches had no proper description, so I added an if/else conditional when there is no description.

##Lessons Learned:

A lot of apis have bad organization, like the wikipedia one.
