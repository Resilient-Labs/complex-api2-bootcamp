# ðŸ“Š Project: Complex API 2

### Goal: Use data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned

For this complex API project I used a random quote generator to generate a quote. That generated quote was then passed into another API that translated it into pig latin.

### What I did to build this app:

I used HTML, CSS, API documentation/url and JavaScript to code this project.

### Lessons Learned :
- I felt much more comfortable nesting APIs by the time I got to this project.
- I also got much more comfortable with some JS fundamentals such as concatenating strings and template literals.
- By this time I had a great understanding also of dot notation and bracket notation to sift through objects.
