# My To do list
This project is a complex API. I used a brewery API along with a sun-rise/sun-set API. I was able to utilize the longitude and latitude coordinates for both APIs to work together, so when you input a city and/or state, it will give you a list of breweries around that area along with the time of sun-rise and sun-set.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I created a wireframe for the complex API with a list stacked on top of each other using HTML. Next I used CSS to give the sections a height, width, and a background color. I also used CSS to margin the inputs and buttons to center them. Next I used JavaScript to create the behavior with the buttons and the list items.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that when using the createElement method, you can add elements into the DOM as well as appending tags into those elements.
I learned a new method called appendChild and how it is used to store a child element into the parent element.
