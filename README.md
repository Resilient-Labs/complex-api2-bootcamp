# Dogs & Cats Image Generator 

Bitter rivals? Perhaps. But, wow do they look cute together! This app requires the user type in their desired number of cat/dog pics they went to return. Cats and dogs are equal here, one input returns the same amount of pictures for both cats and dogs!

<!-- ## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

## Lessons Learned:

I had tough time working with the dogAPI because it did not contain anywhere near as much data as the catAPI.
