# Project: Complex API

# Complex API
An application that when a button is pressed a Rick and Morty character will appear as a text.
Then a list of holidays will be displayed based on the day the character debuted. Holiday will only appear
if there actually holidays on the particular day.

# Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript 
This project took HTML, CSS, and Javascript to get the desired result. I chained together 2 different APIS 
in order to get the relation between Rick and Morty's characters birthday and the holiday that corresponded with that
those birthdays.
# Lessons Learned
This project gave me a lot of creative freedom in developing a solution. I learned how to focus when feeling overwhelmed. I also learned
more about how APIs can talk each other and they kind of applications that can be built from this. This also helped to cement using 
fetch and .then within my mind more, and accessing the data from APIs.
