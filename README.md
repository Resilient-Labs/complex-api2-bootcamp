# ðŸ“Š Project: Complex API 2

### Goal: Use data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned

This is another project using two APIs to display data in the DOM. I love Animal Crossing, so I used both an Animal Crossing and Amiibo API two make this work.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web APIs

I was able to use the ACNH API to gather all of the villager data: The villager name, saying, bio, and birthday. I then used the data from the villager name input to make a request to the Amiibo API and display that specific amiibo card in the DOM. 

## Lessons Learned:

I was glad this complex API worked out, I really wanted to use the ACNH API. Hopefully I can use other parameters to create some cool projects.
