## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:
By the time I did this project, I had already done 6 API projects and felt very comfortable with handling APIs. This was my fastest API project so far. I had never really used tables before, so this project taught me how to set up a table appending table rows and table data with JS.
