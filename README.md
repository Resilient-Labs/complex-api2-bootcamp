## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using an Api to grab the japanese form of the word entered in the input. The input gets sent to the api and the api returns back the japanese writing of the english word. Once the word is recieved, the jisho api grabs the japanese writing and defines it with three or less definitions. 

<!-- ## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

## Things I learned and DISCLAIMERS

This api was th emost fun since I have a huge passion for learning Japanese. To use this api, a simple "fix" is to install the 'Moesif Origin & CORS Changer' extension. It is the only way I found at the time of making to use it to itts fullest extent.
