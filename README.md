## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used two apis for this project. I used the fetch function and passed in a url into it. Then I used one of its key values into another apis parameters to get the bars in an area everytime you plug in an NBA player.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use the createElement() method in this project. Mind blown that you can create html tags through javascript. The possiblities are endless!!!

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
