# Song and Lyrics API

<a href="https://kellychhe-complex-song-and-lyrics-api.netlify.app/">This website</a> was fun to make. The user enters a song title (even if it is not fully correct) and the DOM displays the top search results with the lyrics. The example below is the result of searching "hello".

## Languages Used

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. 

I used the shazam API to get the top five search results (song and artist) as query parameters for the lyrics API. If the lyrics API does not have the lyrics to the song, the song title and artist will be removed from the DOM.

## Lessons Learned

I spent hours on hours trying to find two ~free~ APIs that would pair well together. After making this site, I realize the CSS could use some work, but I do love the background gif. I think next time, I might try bootstrap or another styling database to make it easier.
