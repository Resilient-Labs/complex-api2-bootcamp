# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript E6, API, JSON

# Optimizations:
#### This API feeds one API into a flag API to display country of origin and a separate cannabis API to display the description, effects and flavors. 

# Lesson Learned: 
#### To develop a cohesive app with utility, it is important to take into account the information available in each API.
