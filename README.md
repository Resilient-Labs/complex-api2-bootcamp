## How It's Made

This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

### HTML
- **Video Background:** Utilizes a video background with a poster fallback for visually appealing aesthetics.
- **Meal Details Container:** Contains elements for displaying meal name, ingredients list, meal image, and a button to find similar recipes.

### JavaScript
- **Fetching Random Meal:** Uses the MealDB API to fetch a random meal's details, including name, ingredients, and an image!
- **Finding Similar Recipes:** Uses the Spoonacular API to find and list several meal ideas with similar ingredients to the current meal. 

## Optimizations

The project was optimized for user experience and functionality. Using a video background loop for user appeal, images for user visualization along with the meals, and a list of ideas for meals to cook.

## Lessons Learned

During this project I was able to explore fun ways to add visual appeal. I also encountered several bugs with fetching list item data properly. I was able to handle errors for best user experience and functionality.
